    <p class="about">
      The Central Pennsylvania Open Source Conference (CPOSC)
      is a one-day technical conference for open source users and
      developers. Presentations and sessions cover all aspects of
      open source, with talks ranging from novice to expert skill
      levels and featuring case studies, best practices,
      code-alongs and more. Join us for a day of meeting with and
      learning from your technology peers.
    </p>

    <h3>Why CPOSC?</h3>
    <p>
      Technology is evolving with unprecedented speed,
      which means it's more important than ever for those on
      the front lines of tech to gather, converse and share
      their experiences. CPOSC offers technologists passionate
      about open source technologies that very opportunity
      through presentations, panel discussions, lightning talks,
      informal designated conversation topic areas, and more.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Downtown Lancaster?</h3>
    <p>
      As Downtown Lancaster's arts, music, and dining scenes
      have garnered national recognition over the past decade,
      we firmly believe that the Lancaster tech scene is in
      the midst of its own big boom. By moving downtown
      beginning in 2016, we wanted CPOSC to be at the center
      of this tech explosion. As a bonus, it's an easy walk
      from the Ware Center to the CPOSC After Party at
      <a href="https://www.tellus360.com/">Tellus360!</a>
    </p>

    <h3>What to expect:</h3>
    <p>
      Since its start, CPOSC has featured experienced technologists
      speaking on a variety of open source topics, from introduction
      level to deep dives and from emerging technologies to those
      tried-and-tested. You can also find stories of lessons learned
      with OSS, as well as niche industries like open source
      hardware. There is something for everyone at CPOSC.
